# nndeeplearn
A C++ port of the neural network code presented in the book on http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/

The data used is the MNIST handwriting samples, found here: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. The goal of the code is to be able to determine which number, from 0-9, is written, given an image greyscale file.

Currently, the code gets a success rate of around 95%, using three layers (one hidden layer with 30 nodes).
